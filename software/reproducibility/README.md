# Reproducibility of OMINE

This directory includes the trained models used for experiments, which results are presented in Table 2, Table 4 and Table 5 in the paper.
To reproduce the results of these tables, you have to copy the `params/` directory of each model and paste to `{topology}/mechanism/spatial/spatial{n}/params` directory.
